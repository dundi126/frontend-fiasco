## ✨ About this Repo

Welcome to **Frontend Fiasco** — my personal chaos lab where I rebuild my frontend skills from the ground up!  
Here, you'll find:

- Untamed HTML
- Misbehaving CSS
- JavaScript doing its own thing  
  All working together to eventually form beautiful (and functional) web projects.

This repo is proof that every web developer starts with a bit of a _fiasco_ 💥.

## 💾 Notes to Self

- This is a **safe zone** for ugly code, spaghetti styles, and broken buttons.
- No judgment allowed.
- Improvement is the only goal (and maybe a few memes along the way).
